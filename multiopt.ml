(** Multiopt provides multi-objective search strategies.  Currently implements
    NSGA-II, based on:
    http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/10429-nsga-ii-a-multi-objective-optimization-algorithm*)

(* Note: CLG did not write this and has made minimal effort to understand it.  I
   did, however, reformat a lot to get everything closer to 80 characters per
   line; the use of the imperative style in this module combined with OCaml's
   standard indentation practices meant that basically everything was shifted
   really far to the right by the time we got to step 3.3 of the algorithm.  I
   thus do a lot of let _ = imperative computation in, trying to break up the
   computation into the steps suggested by the algorithm.  This is only in the
   interest of readability *)

(* The implementation of NGSA-II below requires O(n^2) fitness lookups. The
   md5sum-based fitness cache from the Rep module is much faster than
   re-evaluating the variant's fitness, but is noticeably slow during replay.
   So we create our own cache here, using the rep name as a key.

   NOTE: this asusmes that name1 == name2 implies fitness1 == fitness2.
